It is called 14 times, (between the values of 0 and 15) and because the variable i is declared in the for loop and is then being passed to the makeSquare recipe, each time the function runs, i changes in value (+1). Thus, the attributes that involve the i change in value as well (eg. the id attribute changes to be whatever i was last time, plus 1.)//
