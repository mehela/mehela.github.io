Journal Entry #1:

 This week in comp-sci we learned about meta. We also learned about a guy named Deryk and his journey of building a flying machine from scratch. I enjoyed watching the video about his flying machine journey!

 Journal Entry #2:

 This week in comp-sci, we did alot of work on our websites and out person cards! It was lots of in class work, and we got alot done. I polished up my homepage and it looks really nice! I like the colors and it is slowly starting to look like a real website. My person card is coming together... I did not completely like the GIF but its not bad so i'm keeping it.

Journal Entry #3:

This week, we did lots of in-class work on our websites! I am not confident on pulishing my website online, and I know how to do it. We learned about CSS Animations as well. One thing I really enjoyed making my website coherent. I played with fonts and sizes, and I really enjoyed that! I enjoyed making my website pleasing and watching it all come together.

Journal Entry #4:
For this week's code sketch, I incorperated what we learned in class. I made a bunch of color patterns that when they are clicked on, changes. At first I thought it would be very simple, but it was not. It was alot of changing numbers and variables. There were some little problems where I did not fix small mistakes, but after that, it started coming together.
